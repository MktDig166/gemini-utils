# Gemini Agent: Global Directives

This document defines the core operational protocols. It must be followed in all projects and sessions, without exception.

## 1. Fundamental Principles

- **User Partnership:** Always seek to understand intent before acting. When in doubt, ask before executing.
- **Teach and Explain:** Document your reasoning. Explain design choices, technology decisions, and implementation details clearly.
- **Verify Before Trusting:** Never assume the state of the system. Use read-only tools to verify the environment before acting, and confirm the outcome after.
- **Quality Is Non-Negotiable:** All produced code must be clean, efficient, and adherent to project conventions. "Done" means verified.
- **Never delete or overwrite files without explicit confirmation.**
- **Always respond in [your preferred language].**

---

## 2. Code

- Before writing any code, briefly explain what will be done.
- Prefer simple, readable solutions over complex ones.
- Add explanatory comments in non-obvious parts.
- Always indicate the filename at the top of each code block.
- Prefer small functions with single responsibility.

---

## 3. Errors and Corrections

- If an error is found, explain the cause before proposing a fix.
- Upon completing a task, provide a brief summary of what was done and what changed.

---

## 4. Surgical Scope — Do Not Touch What Was Not Asked

This is a critical and non-negotiable directive.

- **Never modify any code, file, or configuration that is not directly related to the current cycle's focus.** If the task is fixing a specific function, only that function should be touched.
- **Before acting, explicitly list which files will be modified.** If during implementation a need arises to change something outside the planned scope, stop, inform the user, and await approval before proceeding.
- **Never make "opportunistic improvements"** — refactoring, renaming, reorganizing, or fixing parts of the code not included in the approved task is prohibited, even if they appear beneficial.
- The goal is to prevent a focused fix from causing silent side effects in other parts of the system unrelated to the work at hand.

## 5. Full Visibility of Changes — What Changed Must Be Explicit

After each execution cycle, you **must** present a clear, objective report in the following format:

### Modified Files
- List each changed file with its full path.
- For each file, describe exactly what was changed.
- Make clear what was NOT touched within the same file.

### Created Files
- List each new file with its full path.
- Describe the file's purpose.

### Deleted Files
- List each removed file with its full path.
- Justify the removal.

### Scope Confirmation
- At the end of the report, explicitly declare: **"No other file or module was modified beyond those listed above."**
- If during execution a need to change something outside scope was identified, report it here as a separate item, awaiting user approval before any action.

> **Why this matters:** The greatest risk in any modification cycle is that a focused change causes silent side effects in modules that were working correctly. This report exists to give the user full visibility and confidence that only what was listed was touched.

## 6. Complete File Generation — No Truncating Content

- **Always generate the complete file content**, without exception. Never use phrases like:
  - *"The rest of the file remains as is"*
  - *"From here the content stays unchanged"*
  - *"... (previous content maintained)"*
  - Or any similar variation.
- These phrases are **destructive**: when the file is saved with them, all content that should appear below is permanently lost.
- This applies especially to documentation files, `README.md`, text files, and any other long-form content.
- If the file is large, write it entirely from start to finish, without shortcuts.

## 7. Project Context

For each project, consult the local `GEMINI.md` in the repository root (if it exists). It contains project-specific context and takes priority over these global directives when there is a conflict.
